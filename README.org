 This repository contains a prototype mapping app for the global food system.
 The goal of this project is a global, comprehensive, open source mapping of our
 food supply chains including the demand side. From comparable past economic
 crises such as the great depression of the 1930s we can predict market failures
 in allocating essential goods in the next months not just in poor countries.
 Compared to the 1930s most of our goods depend critically on international
 supply chains and hence our chronic lack of international governance bodies
 that can intervene to coordinate national efforts against market failures
 render us arguably worse prepared than the nation states of the 1930s.

 Signs of the market failures are already visible as ripple effects popping up
 as food dumps and destruction in the media, besides the horrific messages about
 [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdrJjyADDmM][pending hunger catastrophies]] in poor countries such as India, East African
 states or parts of Latin America. As the economic downturn of the global
 economy sharpens the effects on supply chains become very hard to predict even
 for corporate actors. By explicitly mapping supply and demand of food related
 goods we want to facilitate direct allocation and interventions through
 governance bodies and direct collective coordination to minimize food
 shortages. A systematic effort to quantifying the goods flowing through our
 global economy is therefore required. This project is about providing tooling
 for such efforts.

** Preconditions
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h:4656009e-1c51-427f-a67a-d80d7f1b942d
   :END:
   - Contributors care about food security and do not want to blindly trust that
     this crisis is managed well by some people without having public
     transparency.
   - Contributors want to coordinate globally to map food supply chains.
   - Technical contributors have access to a Unix machine with node.js support
     and are willing to setup a shadow-cljs workflow. To run the server they need
     to have [[https://leiningen.org/][leiningen]] and a JDK >= 8 installed.
  
 
** Postconditions
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: h:35d3e832-bad5-4c68-97da-9d4992c7e5fc
   :END:
   - We have a set of publicly available services at hand to map food supply
     chain information and do quantitative account to ensure integrity of the
     supply chain.
   - We have not let millions of people starve because of a lack of coordination
     and the ignorance of the media bubbles in first world countries.
   - We have collected crucial information to tackle the biggest problems of the
     21st century such as climate change.

 This is an early effort, yet the urgency and uncertainty of the situation
 convinced us to push as much as possible while iteratively rethinking on the
 way. We cannot yet expose this tool to a large audience, but we want to make it
 accessible as soon as possible. If you have constructive or critical suggestions
 please join our [[https://t.me/joinchat/BL1x7hgkCwwW8MqOKsFpvg][chat]] or open an issue here. Our tooling is deliberately not
 aimed at direct automation, e.g. firehosing news sources onto the map, since
 this will obscure how the tools will be used. Instead we need to figure the
 processes out with our community of users (read: you! :) ). We have experience
 in building scalable systems and will be able to scale up quickly once we know
 what we need. In particular we are able to provide modern economic tools for
 compositional game theory, probabilistic simulations and planning. To get to a
 state were we can benefit from this technology we need to systematically measure
 and quantify what is going on though. If you think this is a good investment of
 your time in these "interesting times", join us!

 We will provide P2P [[https://lambdaforge.io/2019/12/08/replicate-datahike-wherever-you-go.html][real time streams]] on our horizontally read scalable [[http://github.com/replikativ/datahike][database
 technology]]. We are in the process of creating a globally addressable registry of
 such databases which track important public information in form of knowledge
 commons. If you are interested in providing such a database, please open up an
 issue here.

 We use the pragmatic functional programming language [[https://clojure.org][Clojure]] which emphasizes
 short feedback cycles and interactive development. To setup an interactive
 development environment for this web frontend, please take a look at [[https://shadow-cljs.org/][shadow-cljs]].

 This prototype uses [[https://github.com/replikativ/datahike-server/][datahike-server]] as a backend, which will probably be
 replaced by a dedicated backend with geo indexing support in the next
 iterations. 

 You need to clone the datahike server repository and run it locally by executing

 #+BEGIN_SRC bash
 lein run
 #+END_SRC

 in the cloned directory.

 To build the static fields for the frontend you have to clone the repository and
 then run the following commands in the directory:

 #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   npm install
   npx shadow-cljs compile app
 #+END_SRC

 Any static web server will do it. If you have Python installed you can start a
 simple web server:


 #+BEGIN_SRC bash
 cd resources/public && python -m http.server 8080
 #+END_SRC

 To build an optimized, bundled release run:
 #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   npx shadow-cljs release app
 #+END_SRC
